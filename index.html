    <h1>Inking Gone Poorly | Jack Kirby's Comic Sketches</h1>
    <h2>by Ethan Vilchis Macedo</h2>
</body>
<p>Jack Kirby was a comic book penciler who worked in both Marvel Comics and DC Comics respectively. Kirby was born in 1917 and died in 1994. Kirby has created numerous well-known comic book icons like Captain America, The Fantastic Four, The Silver Surfer, and Darkseid. He was drafted and served in the US Army in 1943.</p>
<p>This topic is rather important for me because A lot of comic panels have been lost to time, and haven't been properly archived. Lots of these sketches were also modified later on to be published, but the inking process has lost a lot of the original when translating into a new material. Jack Kirby is the man who created such intricate and gorgeous pieces of art, and unfortunately lots of these sketches were inked by someone who didn't care for his art, just wanted to get the job done and get paid. This is the reason why I want to archive his beautiful sketches, preserve them as time goes on.</p>   
<p>The inker is Vince Colletta. He was an inker (originally a penciler), but primarily worked on inking. Jack Kirby was given Colletta in Kid Colt Outlaw in 1961. He was not a bad inker given his prior work in romance comics, but superheroes took time. Romance comics didn't. That was the mentality that Colletta had in mind whenever working in Marvel and for Jack Kirby. Thankfully there are photos of the original sketches that Kirby has done. In this project, I will demonstrate the key differences between the original Kirby sketch, to inked/finished panels done by Colletta and other colorists. The point to archive Kirby's sketches is to show that his craft was disrespected, and was not given the time and effort it truly deserved to have. Comics are an art form, we as a group consume comic-like products, and comic-inspired things, and to have Jack Kirby's art be disrespected is a shame. </p>
